# python_learning
This repository will contain my journey through learning some Python 3!

## Things I've learned so far:
* The `import` statement allows me to import modules to use the stuff inside
* Making lists from which to draw data from
> A list is an ordered sequence of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. But the main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position. -- https://www.python-course.eu/python3_dictionaries.php
