# Learning Python 3
This repository will contain my journey through learning some Python 3!

## Things I've learned so far:

### Print function used for printing lines
* Also super helpful for printing lists to make sure everything was included in my lists correctly
* Converting integers to strings when printing

### Variables

### For Loops
* Making for loops and embedding them
* Realizing the importance of indentation in Python
* Syntax differences from other languages

### The `import` statement allows me to import modules to use the stuff inside

### Making, changing, and using Lists
> A list is an ordered sequence of objects, whereas dictionaries are unordered sets. But the main difference is that items in dictionaries are accessed via keys and not via their position. -- https://www.python-course.eu/python3_dictionaries.php

* Creating lists
* Using For Loops to generate all the possible permutations between two lists of strings/integers 
* Adding new items to an empty list using `append`
* Using an f-String to ensure the items generated from a list with mixed integers and strings combine to form a string
* Combining two lists together to make one large list

### Using the `random` module
* Drawing a random item from a list using `random.choice()`
